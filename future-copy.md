## Built with your feedback section (removed from index.html)

**Heading:** Built with your feedback

**Body text:**
We're building Magic City Savers entirely based on input from early users.

We're especially looking for feedback like:

**Example quotes:**
- "This feature is really helpful"
- "This didn't actually save me money"
- "This made shopping faster"
- "I wouldn't use this again unless…"

**Closing text:**
If Magic City Savers ever becomes truly useful, it'll be because people told us what worked — and what didn't.
